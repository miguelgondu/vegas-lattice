This is a tutorial on how to use vegas-lattice.

First, we begin with a short physical and mathematical introduction to lattices. `Mathematically <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_%28group%29>`_, one can consider lattices as subgroups of :math:`\mathbb{R}^n` formed by considering two linearly independent translations, but we will take a physical approach (and, for that , we will follow the `ALPS <http://alps.comp-phys.org/mediawiki/index.php/Tutorials:LatticeHOWTO:SimpleGraphs>`_ webpage's tutorial).

    First of all, an introduction to the notion of translations and a couple
    images. Then, using a constructor to build a lattice, ...
